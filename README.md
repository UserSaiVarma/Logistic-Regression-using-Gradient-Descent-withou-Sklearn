# Logistic-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent-without-Sklearn
Derived Logistic Regression from scratch #Refer 'Derivation of Logistic Regression.pdf'<br>
Note: Ignored 'Regularization' term in the formula for the sake of simplicity and also there is no hard math involved in differentiating the regularization term <br>
Implemented Logistic Regression in python using Gradient Descent using 'Logistic loss' without using Sklearn<br>
