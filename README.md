# Logistic-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent-without-Sklearn
Implemented Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent using 'Logistic loss' without using Sklearn<br>
Note: Ignored 'Regularization' term in the formula for the sake of simplicity and also there is no hard math involved in differentiating the regularization term
